Public Key Encryption from Trapdoor Permutations
===

#### Constructions

**Trapdoor functions**:

* A trapdoor function form set X -> set Y is a triple of efficient algs (G, F, F<sup>-1</sup>)
* G(): randomized alg outputs a key pair (pk, sk)
* F(pk, .): det. alg. that defines a function X -> Y
* F<sup>-1</sup>(sk, .): defines a function Y -> X that inverts F(pk, .)
* ‚àÄ(pk, sk) output by G and ‚àÄ x ‚àà X:  F<sup>-1</sup>(sk, F(pk, x)) = x
* (G, F, F<sup>-1</sup>) is secure if F(pk, .) is a one-way function, ie, it can be evaluated, but not inverted without sk.
* More formally, if the adversary is given pk and y <- F(pk, x), he will output x'. (G, F, F<sup>-1</sup>) is a secure TDF if for all efficient A: Adv<sub>OW</sub>[A, F] = Pr[x=x'] < negligible

**Review of modular arithmetic**:

* Let N = p.q where p, q are prime and p, q ‚âà sqrt(N)
* ‚Ñ§<sub>N</sub> = {0, 1, ..., N-1}
* ‚Ñ§<sub>N</sub><sup>* </sup> = invertible elements in ‚Ñ§<sub>N</sub>
* x ‚àà ‚Ñ§<sub>N</sub> <=> (implies and implied by) gcd(x, N) = 1
* sizeof(‚Ñ§<sub>N</sub><sup>* </sup>) = ùúë(N) = (p-1)(q-1) = N - p - q + 1
* ùúë(N) ‚âà N - 2.sqrt(N) + 1 ‚âà N. A random element in ‚Ñ§<sub>N</sub> is *very likely* to be an element in ‚Ñ§<sub>N</sub><sup>* </sup> as well
* Euler's theorem - ‚àÄ x ‚àà ‚Ñ§<sub>N</sub><sup>* </sup>: x<sup>ùúë(N)</sup> = 1 in ‚Ñ§<sub>N</sub>

**RSA Trapdoor permutation**:

Used widely. TLS uses it for both certificates and key exchange. Also used for secure email and file systems.

* G()
  1. Choose random primes p, q ‚âà 1024 bits
  2. N = p.q
  3. Choose integers e, d s.t. e.d = 1 (mod ùúë(N))
  4. e = encryption exponent, d = decryption exponent
  5. Ouput pk = (N, e); sk = (N, d)
* F(pk, x): ‚Ñ§<sub>N</sub><sup>* </sup> -> ‚Ñ§<sub>N</sub><sup>* </sup>
  1. Plaintext = x
  2. Ciphertext y = x<sup>e</sup> mod N
* F<sup>-1</sup>(sk, y)
  1. Plaintext = y<sup>d</sup> mod N = x<sup>ed</sup> mod N = x<sup>k.ùúë(N) + 1</sup>= (x<sup>ùúë(N)</sup>)<sup>k</sup>.x = x

**RSA assumption**

* RSA is a one-way permutation
* For all efficient algs. A: Pr[A(N, e, y)=y<sup>1/e</sup>] < negligible
* where p, q are 2 random n-bit primes, N <- p.q, y is randomly distributed in ‚Ñ§<sub>N</sub><sup>* </sup>

**RSA public key encryption (ISO standard)**

* (E<sub>s</sub>, D<sub>s</sub>) symmetric encryption schemes providing authenticated encryption
* H: ‚Ñ§<sub>N</sub> -> K where K is the keyspace of (E<sub>s</sub>, D<sub>s</sub>) (say SHA-256)
* G(): Generate RSA params pk = (N, e); sk = (N, d)
* E(pk, m)
  1. Choose random x in ‚Ñ§<sub>N</sub>
  2. y <- RSA(x) = x<sup>e</sup>
  3. k <- H(x),
  4. c <- E<sub>s</sub>(k, m)
  5. Output (y, c)
* D(sk, (y, c))
  1. Output D<sub>s</sub>(H(RSA<sup>-1</sup>(y)), c)

**Textbook RSA**

* Generate RSA params pk = (N, e); sk = (N, d)
* Encrypt c <- m<sup>e</sup>
* Decrypt c<sup>d</sup> -> m

This is not semantically secure, because its deterministic

=> the RSA trapdoor permutation is not an encryption scheme

Simple attack

* Client says hello to the server
* Server responds with (e, N)
* Client chooses a random k and sends c = RSA(k) = k<sup>e</sup>
* Eve knows e, N, and c
* There is a 20% chance that k can be factorized into 2 numbers k<sub>1</sub>, k<sub>2</sub>
* c = (k<sub>1</sub>.k<sub>2</sub>)<sup>e</sup>
* Eve tries a meet-in-the-middle attack. c/k<sub>1</sub><sup>e</sup> = k<sub>2</sub><sup>e</sup>
* A 64 bit key can be broken in ‚âà 2<sup>40</sup> time, which is much better than exhaustive search - 2<sup>64</sup>

#### PKCS1

**RSA public key encryption (in practice)**

1. System generates a symmetric key, of say 128-bits
2. Preprocessing is done on the key to expand it to 2048-bits
3. RSA is used to encrypt the expanded key

**PKCS1 v1.5**:

The expanded 2048-bit key from most significant bit to least:

1. 16 bits - 02, indicating PKCS1
2. ~1900 bits - random, but not containing the 16 bits ff
3. The 16 bits ff, indicating that the key follows
4. The key

This was used in HTTPS. In 1998, Bleichenbacher found a vulnerability based on the fact that the server will tell you if the first two bytes are 02 or not.

* Choose r ‚àà ‚Ñ§<sub>N</sub>. Compute c' <- r<sup>e</sup>c = (r.PKCS1(m))<sup>e</sup>
* Send c' and check the response

After a million such requests, it is possible to recover m completely.

Defense: if the first two bits are invalid, the server should continue with a random string generated at the start of the decryption. Eventually the session will break down because client and server have different secrets.

**PKCS1 v2.0 - OAEP**:

<center>![diagram](http://i.imgur.com/a6XewSm.png)</center>

1. Pad message. Generate random bits such that len(message || pad || random) = 2047
2. Plaintext to encrypt = message ‚®Å H(rand) || rand ‚®Å G(message ‚®Å H(rand))

Security: Assuming that RSA is a trapdoor permutation and H, G are random oracles (ideal hash functions), RSA-OAEP (Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding) is CCA-secure. In practice, SHA-256 is used for H and G

Implementation note: while writing the decryption function, it is very easy to make the mistake of leaking timing information, leading to an attack similar to Bleichenbacher's. Lesson: don't implement crypto yourself

#### Is RSA a one-way function?

To invert the RSA function without d, attacker must compute x from x<sup>e</sup> mod N. How hard is computing the e'th root modulo N? The best known algorithm is:

1. Factor N (hard)
2. Compute e'th roots modulo p and q (Easy).
3. Combine both using Chinese Remainder theorem to recover e'th root modulo N (Easy)

We claim that there is no efficient algorithm for computing the e'th root modulo N, since there is weak evidence that if it existed, factoring N (step 1) would be easy.

**How not to optimize RSA**

* Speeding up decryption: exponentiation to the power d takes O(log(d)), so one (bad) way is to suggest small values of d, say 128-bit d instead of a 2000-bit d. Weiner'87 proved that if d < N<sup>0.25</sup> then RSA is insecure. BD'98 proved it insecure for d < N<sup>0.292</sup>. Its conjectured that it is insecure for d < N<sup>0.5</sup>
* Lesson - Imposing limitations on d is a bad idea.

#### RSA in practice

**Implementation**

* To speed up RSA encryption use a small e.
* Minimum value = 3. Recommended value = 65537 = 2<sup>16</sup> + 1 (needs 17 multiplications).
* RSA is asymmetric - fast encryption/slow decryption. For e = 65537, decryption would take approx. 2000 multiplications
* Decryption commonly uses the Chinese Remainder Theorem. This yields a speedup of 4x
  1. x<sub>p</sub> = c<sup>d</sup> in ‚Ñ§<sub>p</sub> is calculated
  2. x<sub>q</sub> = c<sup>d</sup> in ‚Ñ§<sub>q</sub> is calculated
  3. The two are combined to get x = c<sup>d</sup> in ‚Ñ§<sub>N</sub>

**Attacks**

* Timing attack - time taken for decryption (c<sup>d</sup> mod N) can expose d. Defense - make sure decryption time should be independent of the arguments
* Power attack - measuring the power consumption of a smartcard while it is computing c<sup>d</sup> mod N can expose d
* Faults attack - a computer error durign c<sup>d</sup> mod N can expose d. Defense - check the output by computing (c<sup>d</sup>)<sup>e</sup> mod N
  1. x<sub>p</sub> is calculated correctly, but because of a rare processor error, x<sub>q</sub> is not
  2. The output is x', rather than x
  3. x' = c<sup>d</sup> in ‚Ñ§<sub>p</sub> but x' != c<sup>d</sup> in ‚Ñ§<sub>q</sub>
  4. => x'<sup>e</sup> = c in ‚Ñ§<sub>p</sub> but x'<sup>e</sup> != c in ‚Ñ§<sub>q</sub>
  5. => gcd(x'<sup>e</sup> - c, N) = p, meaning a factor of N is now known
  6. It is now possible to compute ùúë(N) and break RSA, all from a single mistake.
* Poor key generation - many firewalls create a key-pair at startup, when entropy is low. The first prime p is thus common across many such instances. q would be random, since its generated a few ms later. But if you have 2 public keys with a common p, its possible to do gcd(N<sub>1</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>) to recover p and from there recover q. Defense - Make sure the random number generator is properly seeded.
