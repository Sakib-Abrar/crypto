Notes
===

These are the notes for [Crypto I](https://www.coursera.org/course/crypto) course on Coursera, conducted by Prof. Dan Boneh of Stanford. When [Crypto II](https://www.coursera.org/course/crypto2) takes place, the notes will be uploaded here as well.

The notes are collated into a single PDF which you can find in the [Releases](https://github.com/nindalf/crypto/releases) section.
