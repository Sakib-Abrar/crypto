Crypto code and notes
---

I keep all the code and notes related to cryptography in this repo. They're classified under

* stanford - Notes for the Coursera [course on cryptography](https://class.coursera.org/crypto-015).
* matasano - Code for the [Matasano crypto challenges](http://cryptopals.com).
* aes - Implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard

If you're interested in crypto, I'd recommend checking the first two out.

The code for the challenges are WIP, I have finished 16 out of 56 problems in total. In case you'd like to learn more about them, here's a [good intro](https://blog.pinboard.in/2013/04/the_matasano_crypto_challenges/).
