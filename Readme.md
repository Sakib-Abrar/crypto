These are the solutions to the problems on [cryptopals.com](http://cryptopals.com), written in Go. Its currently a work in progress. I strongly recommend that no one read the solutions if they plan to attempt the problems themselves because that would spoil the fun.

For an introduction to the problem set, check out [this article](https://blog.pinboard.in/2013/04/the_matasano_crypto_challenges/).
